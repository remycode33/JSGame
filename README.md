# WELCOME AND BE READY TO HAVE FUN WITH THIS LITTLE GAME 🕹️🐍📝⏱️🎾

## 1 - The aim ❓

The aim of this game is to eat the balls as soon as possible so don't wait and press your keys ! 🏃💨

## 2 - How to play 🙋

Click on the link where the page is living the game will start after the animation.

You have to use your arrow keys ⬅️⬆️➡️⬇️ to move the purple ball and go through the green ball to eat them.

• You can either spam your key either stay pushed.

• The normal green balls give you 1 point wherease the superball (the one who change of color) give you 4 points.

• I should not to tell you this tricks but it's possible to block a ball with the mouse so you can eat it easiler 🤫🤐

## 3 - Concept 🐍🥎

This game is a mix between a snake and a pacman. I added a feature : the ghost traject, who allows you to see what way you did with your ball to eat the food. Older the traject is, transparenter it is.

## 4 - Why I developted it ? 🧑‍💻

I developted this project from scratch with no internet to have fun and to manipulate a bit the DOM, the events, the intervals, to code in POO and to see what I can do with my knowledge. I did it at the end of my first training. 

## 5 - The project : 📝

The project is built in JAVASCRIPT Vanilla.

I used WebPack to bundle my JS files in one.

The project is at the first version V1.0.0.

## 6 - Disclamair 📎

I know this project is not perfect, i did a bit of factoring to avoid to repeat myself but there is again work to make the code clearer and understable.
If you check the code, you will see that I use both way to do class, with function and with class. And same with the function, I didn't use only arrow function which is the recommended way now with ES6.
I did it voluntary just because this was my first wn project and I wanted to manipulate JS also in this way. 
Also as explain previewsly I do implement this game by using the DOM, it means that I didn't use a Canvas as I should have done just because it was my objective to manipulate the DOM. 
The project is not finished I will continue it few by few to add some features, clean/ modernize the code, refactore it also.
I wanted mainly to have a little game who works and manipulate JS in a different way.

## 7 - Last words : 📍

If you have some ideas of features you would like to see in this game don't hesitate to share it with me I would work on this with pleasure !
Also if you liked it or in opposite if you didnt't like you can share with me this reasons who made your experience good or bad so I can work to improve it or apply the good points on another project :)
